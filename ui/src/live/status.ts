// The live status store, as the tower streams it.
//
// Three rules carried from the predecessor's `live/store.ts`, because they
// were paid for once and are still right:
//
//   Level-triggered. Every message is a WHOLE snapshot for one venue, never a
//   difference — so this store REPLACES and never patches, and a dropped
//   message costs one interval rather than information. It is also why the
//   server may drop at all.
//
//   Once seen, never dropped. A venue that stops publishing stays here with
//   its age climbing, because absence after presence is the statement an
//   operator most needs rendered. Removing it would make a dead venue look
//   like one that never existed.
//
//   Counted, never judged. Reconnects and missed snapshots are numbers the
//   screen shows. Whether either is acceptable is the operator's.
